Threads: An entity within a process that can be scheduled (also known as a "lightweight" process)
A Procress can spawn multiple Threads

+ all threads within a process share the same memory
+ lightweight
+ Starting a thread is faster than Starting a process
+ Great for I/O-bound tasks

- Threading is limited by GIL: Only one thread at a time
- No effect for CPU-bound tasks
- Not interruptable/killable
- Careful with race conditions
